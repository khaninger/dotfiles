# My Dotfiles
A home-manager based config for emacs, shell utilities, and misc dev tools. 

Mostly tested on WSL Ubuntu, assumes the $USER is same as windows login for the windows bits.

Setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/khaninger/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash setup.sh

```
Run `setup.sh` to install.

# Windows?
This folder has dotfiles that go into `C:\\Users\$USER` for wezterm, wsl itself, and also a shortcut script `.startemacs.vbs`
